Note: When the engine is turned off, it will automatically default to DRCC.(3) Acceleration when there are no longer any preceding vehicles driving slower than the set speed The system accelerates until the set speed is reached. The system then returns to constant speed cruising. 1.5 secondsADJUSTING DISTANCE (CONTINUED) Refer to the Toyota Owner\u2019s Manual for additional information on DRCC operation, settings adjustments, limitations, and precautions before attempting to use it.To adjust speed or cancel, see steps (2) and (3) of ADJUSTING SET SPEED on page 37.Increase speed Decrease speed OVERVIEW FEATURES & OPERATIONS TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE SAFETY & EMERGENCY FEATURES 40AHB is a safety system designed to help",

When enabled, AHB uses an in-vehicle camera to help detect the headlights of oncoming vehicles and tail lights of preceding vehicles, then automatically switches between high and low beams as appropriate to provide the most light possible and enhance forward visibility. By using high beams more frequently, the system may allow earlier detection of pedestrians and obstacles. Refer to the Toyota Owner\u2019s Manual for additional information on AHB operation, settings adjustments, limitations, and precautions before attempting to use it.Automatic High Beams (AHB) (1) With the engine switch in IGNITION ON mode, turn the headlight switch to \u201cAUTO\u201d or \u201c \u201cposition. (2) Push lever away from you. (3) Press the \u201c \u201d switch. The AHB indicator will come on when the headlights are turned on automatically to indicate that the system is active.

Pulsing releases brake pressure repeatedly for fractions of a second. This helps the tires attain the traction that current road conditions will allow, helping you to stay in directional control. BRAKE ASSIST (BA) Brake Assist is designed to detect sudden or \u201cpanic\u201d braking, and then add braking pressure to help decrease the vehicle\u2019s stopping distance. When there\u2019s only a split second to react, Brake Assist can add additional brake pressure more quickly than just the driver alone can. ELECTRONIC BRAKE FORCE DISTRIBUTION (EBD) Toyota\u2019s ABS technology has Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD) to help maintain control and balance when braking. EBD responds to sudden stops by redistributing brake force to enhance the braking effectiveness of all four wheels.Your vehicle comes standard with the Star Safety System TM, which combines Anti- lock Braking System (ABS), Brake Assist (BA), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Smart Stop Technology (SST), Traction Control (TRAC) and Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), Refer to the Owner\u2019s Manual for more details and important information on limitations to these systems.

SMART STOP TECHNOLOGY (SST) Smart Stop Technology automatically reduces engine power when the accelerator and brake pedals are pressed simultaneously under certain conditions. SST engages when the accelerator is depressed first and the brakes are applied firmly for longer than one-half second at speeds greater than five miles per hour. SST doesn\u2019t engage if the brake pedal is depressed before the accelerator pedal, allowing vehicles to start on a steep hill and safely accelerate without rolling backward. ENHANCED VEHICLE STABILITY CONTROL (VSC) Enhanced Vehicle Stability Control provides cooperative control of the ABS, TRAC, VSC and EPS. Enhanced VSC helps to maintain directional stability when loss of traction occurs during a turn. 47 OVERVIEW FEATURES & OPERATIONS TOYOTA SAFETY SENSE SAFETY & EMERGENCY FEATURESFloor mat installation There are two types of Toyota floor mats: carpeted and all-weather.

Always align the \u0394 marks.TRACTION CONTROL (TRAC) VSC helps prevent loss of traction during cornering by reducing engine power, and Traction Control helps maintain traction on loose gravel and wet, icy, or uneven surfaces by applying brake force to the spinning wheel(s). Toyota\u2019s TRAC sensors are activated when one of the drive wheels starts to slip. TRAC limits engine output and applies the brakes to the spinning wheel. This transfers power to the wheels that still have traction to help keep you on track. 48BLUETOOTH\u00ae DEVICE PAIRING SECTION Do not attempt the Bluetooth\u00ae Pairing process while driving. 49To begin the Bluetooth\u00ae Pairing process, press the HOME button on the faceplate of your multimedia system.
